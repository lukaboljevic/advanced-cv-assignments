# Kalman filter and Particle tracker

This assignment was about testing the performance of Kalman filter on artificially created trajectories, and implementing the particle tracker.

`Kalman derivation.md` contains the derivations for the various matrices used by Kalman filter.

`particle_tracker.py` contains the implementation of the particle tracker, and `test_tracker.py` is a similar script like in Assignment 2, used to run the tracker on VOT 2014 sequences.
