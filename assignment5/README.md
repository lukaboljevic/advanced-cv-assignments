# SiamFC short and long term tracker

This assignment was about the SiamFC short term tracker, and then extending it to be a long term tracker.

Most of the code for this assignment was already provided for us by the professors. We only had to extend SiamFC to be a long term tracker. The implementation is found in folder `siamfc`, in `siamfc.py`.

The `short_term_siamfc` and `long_term_siamfc_*` folders are the predictions returned by the short term/long term SiamFC tracker for each frame in the sequence. The sequences themselves are not part of the VOT2014 dataset used in previous 3 assignments, but are separate i.e. new.

The idea of `*.sh` scripts is similar as those in Assignment 3.
