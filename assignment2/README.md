# Mean shift tracker

This assignment was about the mean shift mode seeking algorithm, and mean shift tracker.

Mean shift mode seeking is implemented in `ms.py`, while the tracker implementation can be found in `ms_tracker.py`. This folder also contains the implementation of a discriminative correlation tracker (`correlation_tracker.py`), which is actually part of Assignment 3, but was included here so it can be tested outside the toolkit used in Assignment 3.

The trackers can be tested on VOT2014 sequences by running the script `test_tracker.py`.
